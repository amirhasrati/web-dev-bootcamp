        <h2>Ghost Town</h2>
        <p>
            Below a blue, overhanging peak <br>
            a drift of miner's houses: <br>
            news-papered walls, tin roofs. <br>

            The lanky moon keeps swaggering through <br>
            the small details of death and birth. <br>
            The town, a pillow of dry leaves, <br>
            disintegrates. <br>

            <b>Tyrannosaurus</b><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus#cite_note-2">[nb
                    1]</a></sup> is a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus">genus</a> of large
            theropod
            dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning
            "king" in Latin), often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods.
            It lived
            throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.
            Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock
            formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the Upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago.
            It was
            the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the
            Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a
            long,
            heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but
            unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures
            up
            to 12.3–12.4 m (40.4–40.7 ft) in length; however, according to most modern estimates, T. rex could grow
            to
            lengths of over 12.4 m (40.7 ft), up to 3.66–3.96 m (12–13 ft) tall at the hips, and 8.87 metric tons
            (9.78 short tons) in body mass. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size,
            it is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the strongest bite
            force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex
            was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians
            and
            nkylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger.
            The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest
            debates
            in paleontology. Most paleontologists today accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a
            scavenger.

        <h2>Paleobiology</h2>

        <h3>Feeding strategies</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Tyrannosaur arms are short when compared to other known predators. Horner argues that the arms were
                too
                short to make the necessary gripping force to hold on to prey.[193] Other paleontologists such as
                Thomas
                Holtz Jr. argued that there are plenty of modern-day predators that do not use their forelimbs to
                hunt such
                as wolves, hyenas, and secretary birds as well as other extinct animals thought to be predators that
                would
                not have used their forelimbs such as phorusrhacids.[194][195]</li>
            <li>Tyrannosaurs had large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These
                suggest a
                highly developed sense of smell which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern
                vultures do.
                Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly
                developed
                sense of smell of 21 sampled dinos
                aurs.[166]</li>
            <li>Tyrannosaur teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as
                possible from
                carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. Karen Chin and colleagues have found bone
                fragments in
                coprolites (fossilized feces) that they attribute to tyrannosaurs, but point out that a
                tyrannosaur's teeth
                were not well adapted to systematically chewing bone like hyenas do to extract marrow.[196]</li>
            <li>Since at least some of Tyrannosaurus's potential prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked
                instead of
                ran could indicate that it was a scavenger.[191] On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that
                Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been fast enough
                to prey
                on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.[150][24]</li>
